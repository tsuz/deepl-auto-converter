1. You're ready to go!

## Usage

Once you have added the API key, you can now highlight any text in the pages.

<video src='../resource/video/highlight.mov' width=180/>

Sometimes, you highlight and expect not to translate. In this case, you can disable this by clicking on the `Deepl Auto Converter` icon on the top right of the browser, and change the switch from ON to OFF.
